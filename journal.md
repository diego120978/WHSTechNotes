"Brain rot" describes how shallow digital content can leech focus and energy. Where technology helps me learn and connect, it also diverts me, especially with "slop"—low-quality content. On the other hand, "lore" shows how creativity and storytelling thrive online. To avoid "brain rot", I set limits on screen time, focus on useful content, and make time for offline studying and activities.

Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community.

- In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis).

- In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future.
Starting with the influence of many people, big events are about to occur in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Issues relating to the economy, healthcare, and security come to the fore. Technology makes a great difference in how campaigns implement data to target voters and track opinions, ensuring that the voting system is secure and accurate.

Future technologies, including AI and blockchain, can further secure the efficiency of future elections. AI enables campaigns to more effectively reach out to voters; blockchain enables safer voting, preventing fraud. This can provide even fairer and more transparent elections.

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

1. Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online?

2. What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?

3. Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?

4. How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?

Write a paragraph or more considering these questions. Include examples of actions you can take to safeguard your own data, and reflect on why being cautious online is important for your personal and professional life.
Protecting personal information online is essential because shared data can be misused. To stay secure on platforms like GitHub or social media, avoid posting sensitive details, use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and limit who can access your content. If you’ve shared something too personal, delete it or adjust privacy settings. Balancing openness with privacy means using restricted-access files for collaboration and keeping personal details off public profiles. This caution protects both your personal and professional life.

Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:

1. How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
2. How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
3. How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?

Provide examples where coding knowledge might benefit professionals in various fields. Remember to use specific examples and reflect on how coding can impact your future career path, even if it’s not directly related to computer science.
It helps solve problems because it decomposes large problems into little steps. Having code enables one to know how things are related to health, finance, or education in terms of automating tasks and analyzing data. A health professional could store patients' information with much more order, while a teacher could create learning tools. Programming enhances your creativity by enabling you to build something new, allows collaboration, and is very easy to learn. Even if my career isn't in computer science, coding will help me think better, use technology smarter, and work with others in the technology role.
